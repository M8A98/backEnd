# EJS

* If you want to open a file with res.render(). First you need to creat a new directory called "views",
you need to call it that way because express is goind to look for it.

* We have three types of <%=  %> Add something to the HTML5
                         <%  %> Pure logic like an if statement
                         <%- %> 
                         
* The public folder can be called however you want but "public" is really commonly used.
In order to be able to use it, you need to tell express to use it like you did in app.js.

* Partials are templates so you do not need to copy code.
